Wallet Manager - Project Summary

Overview
Wallet Manager is a specialized digital management application designed to help store owners and small businesses—particularly in Egypt—efficiently organize and track financial operations across multiple mobile wallet services. It acts as a centralized command center for handling daily transactions, monitoring business performance, and ensuring compliance with provider-specific financial limits.

The Problem It Solves
Managing multiple digital wallets (such as Vodafone Cash, Etisalat Cash, Orange Cash, WE Pay, and InstaPay) manually is complex and prone to errors. Store owners often struggle with:
- Tracking balances across different accounts and providers.
- Accidentally exceeding daily or monthly transaction limits.
- accurately calculating transaction fees and commissions.
- Keeping records of customer debts and partial payments.
- Securely managing employee access to sensitive financial data.

Who Benefits?
- Store Owners: Gain full visibility into their financial health, automate limit tracking, and secure their business data.
- Small Businesses: Streamline daily operations involving mobile money transfers and bill payments.
- Employees: Use a simplified, secure interface to perform transactions without needing full administrative access.

How It Helps (Practical Value)
1.  Prevents Errors: Automatically warns users when a transaction is about to exceed the daily or monthly limits for a specific wallet type (e.g., a "New" wallet vs. a "Registered" merchant wallet).
2.  Saves Time: Automates the calculation of service fees and commissions, reducing the need for manual math during busy store hours.
3.  Improves Security: Replaces shared passwords with individual employee PINs and granular permissions, ensuring staff can only perform actions authorized by the owner.
4.  Financial Clarity: Provides instant access to daily reports, total profits, and transaction histories, helping owners make informed business decisions.

Key Features
- Multi-Wallet Dashboard: Manage accounts from all major providers (Vodafone, Etisalat, Orange, WE, InstaPay) in a single view.
- Smart Limit Monitoring: Real-time tracking of transaction limits with visual alerts to prevent blocked transactions.
- Comprehensive Transaction Log: Record Sending, Receiving, and Deposit operations with detailed history and date filtering.
- Debt Tracker: a dedicated system to record customer debts, manage payment status (Open/Paid), and log customer contact details.
- Employee & Access Control: A secure system where owners can create staff accounts with specific permissions (e.g., "can view debts" or "can create transactions") protected by personal PINs.
- Business Analytics: Built-in statistics to view total balances, daily transaction volumes, and commission earnings.
- Secure & Licensed: Protected by a secure license key system and Google Sign-In authentication for owners.

Value Proposition
Wallet Manager transforms a chaotic collection of phones and SIM cards into a streamlined, professional financial system. It empowers business owners to focus on growth rather than administrative headaches, ensuring every pound is accounted for and every transaction is secure.
